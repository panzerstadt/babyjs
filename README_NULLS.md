## an exploration in removing null values in a language

## limitations?

## Use Cases where a null value might be useful

1. searching in a collection
2. trees
3. linked lists
4. optional fields in structures/classes
5. searching in a data structure
6. parsing
7. recursive algorithms, esp. tree/graph traversals, when indicating that a recursion should stop / no valid path was found
8. API design to signify failure or no values
9. error handling where one doesn't want to throw an exception
